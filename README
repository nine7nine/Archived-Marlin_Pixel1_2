README

This is my own kernel for Marlin/Sailfish aka: OG Pixel.

the main purpose of this repo / kernel sources is for my own use, learning about
linux internals, porting, experimentation, etc... 

At this point, it really is only for me and not suitable for other people to
be using (at all). That may change at some point ~ but currently, it's just a 
bad plan to use this kernel/repo. (see below).

NOTES/WARNINGS:

1). I am in the process of porting/modernizing this kernel. Therefore, I 
    highly suggest not trying to fork, compile or use this source code. 

2). It's currently very unstable.

3). it's subject to forced-updates (quite frequently, like everyday).

5). It is absolutely a terrible choice to cherry-pick from, So i would reccomend 
    NOT trying to cherry-pick code from here. why?

- this kernel isn't actually a 3.18.x kernel anymore, most of the core kernel
  is more like linux-4.4 <=> 4.9+, depending on the subsystem... It's really 
  only the dirvers that are (mostly) consistent with 3.18 (and even some of them 
  have necessary changes, due to porting).

- lots of code/commits are incompatible with kernels under android/linux-4.4 
  kernels, other msm8996 kernels or even other marlin kernels.

- many of the changes are dependent on each other and not easily decoupled, nor 
  are dependencies obvious. 

6). When I have stabilized the kernel, I will likely change the "topics" on this
    github repo to reflect that it may be more stable / possibly okay to use ~ 
    but I have absolutely no ETA on that, so don't ask/email me.

7). please do not email me, unless you have a damn good reason to do so.

thanks.
